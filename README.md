## About

Wardrobe is an app that will allow users to take snapshots of their various clothing items and store them in the app. The user can then select a top they own and the app will suggest bottoms to choose from using artificial intelligence and integrated algorithms. 
The app makes suggestions by analyzing the predominate color of the clothing items and uses an algorithm to select the complementary color.
